Peruse, compare, choose color schemes

When the cursor is in the ColorPeruse window:   
<kPlus>      :ColorPeruse 1             (next color)
<kMinus>    :ColorPeruse -1            (prev color)
<kMultiply> :ColorPeruse                 (original color)
<kDivide>   :ColorPeruse 0              (color under cursor)
     =             :call ColorPeruseDel() (remove duplicate lines)
     +             :call ColorPeruseMerge() (append all :set rtp colors to list)
     ?      Help
     :q     quit
 

You are in vim when in the ColorPeruse window, so you can edit items you 
don't like from the list, or place markers to return to re-view particular colorschemes.
You can cut/paste to put favorites or color/lightness groups together 
to compare more closely.
Also, since it is in vim, you can save the ColorPeruse list to a file, or 
load it from a previous perusal list.
